# Biography

I am originally trained as an economist with a Finance major and a Statistics minor. I worked as an analyst and mutual fund portfolio manager for 21 years, then decided to switch to data and data science building on my academic background in Statistics. I also used to teach Statistics for sophomore students at Corvinus University of Budapest.
